# Install for week three

## Setup a GitHub account
If you don't already have a GitHub account set one up here: [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)

## Install Git
Follow the instructions for installing Git on your operating system here: 
https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/.

These instructions will install a GUI version of Git which we won't be using during the session but might be handy in the future. It will install the command line software at the same time.
