## Library Carpetry. Week Three: Git

**Notes: set up website before hand**


### Hour One
- What is Git. What is GitHub. Basic language. Doing the basics.
- *Lesson based on Software Carpentry, [Version Control with Git](https://github.com/swcarpentry/git-novice) ([Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/))*
- the problem? loose changes, collaboration, different versions?
- solution: Version control?

### What is Git? 

Git is a 'free and open source distributed version control system'. We probably know what free and open source means but we might be less sure about what a 'distributed version control system is'. One way to understand what Git and version control systems do is to look at the types of problems they are built to address.

Many of us will have had an experience similar to this. We are working on an important piece of work and we attempt to maintain multiple version of this document in different stages of completeness. 

Version control addresses this problem by recording the changes we make to a document as we proceed. Each of the 'commits' we make is recorded and we can go back across a document or a set of documents and look at what changes have been made. 

Version control allow us to take this one step further and not only record changes to a document one person is working on but allows multiple people to work on a document and record the changes they make. It is then possible to merge these multiple documents. This developed out of a need for groups writing code together to be able to work on coding projects together without having to wait for someone else to finish working on something or having to manually compare changes that are made. 

When we make 'commits' we record a range of metadata about that change. As librarians we might already be inclined to think creating metadata is useful but an example of what information is recorded will illustrate why the information recorded by version control systems in particular is useful. 'Commits' record the time and date of when a commit was made. Although we can often see inforamtion about when we last edited or saved a document this only shows us the most recent changes. When we make commits we can record a message explaining what changes we have made. This makes it especially useful for collaborating. Rather than sending an email with a document with track changes and some comments, we can include all that information with the document itself. This makes it easy to get an overview of changes that have been made to a document by looking at a log of all the changes that have been made. 

####Â Git vs. Github vs. Gitlab

We often hear the terms Git and Github used interchangeably but the are slightly different things. Git refers to the software and principles used for a particular flavour of version control (there are other systems like mercurial and SVN). Github is a popular site which hosts git repositories. The majority of the content that Github hosts is open source software though increasingly it is being used for other projects such as open access journals and constantly updated text books. Github is a great place to learn how to use Git but once you have learned the ideas and processes behid github you can used Git on other storage systems or host repositories on your own server if you wanted to keep code private or you wanted to encrypt your repository. 


#### Using Git 
One of the main barriers to getting started with git is the language. Although some of the language used in Git is fairly self explanatory other terms are not so clear. The best way to get to learn Git language is to begin using it but having an overview of the language and way Git is used will provide a good starting point.

### Hour Two
- Collaborating in groups to build a Github Pages site: who they are, what they think they could use GitHub for **setup a template for use beforehand?**

Github pages 

Setting up a repository 
adding some content
commiting 
making some changes 
collaborating 
managaging conflicts


* build template? Basic site? basic HTML/Markdown?
* css style sheet?

* guidelines handout 
* step by step 

### Hour Three
- Reflecting on what GitHub could be used for in local library setting. Free time to exploring more Software Carpentry lessons and adapting forked repo with suggestions for future Library Carpentry

user contribution to collections?
- editing of resources?
- crowd sourcing - could be an issue?
- making pull requests.
