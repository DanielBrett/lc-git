## Library Carpetry. Week Three: Git

**Notes: set up website before hand**


### Hour One
- What is Git. What is GitHub. Basic language. Doing the basics.
- *Lesson based on Software Carpentry, [Version Control with Git](https://github.com/swcarpentry/git-novice) ([Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/))*
- the problem? loose changes, collaboration, different versions?
- solution: Version control?

### What is Github? 

Git is a 'free and open source distributed version control system'. We probably know what free and open source means but we might be less sure about what a 'distributed version control system is'. One way to understand what Git and version control systems do is to look at the types of problems they are build to address. 


* Version control software, - what does that mean?
* Illustrate the problem? - multiple version, different edits, changes break something (both in code and in texts)












#### Language
Push, pull etc. diagrams and illustrations - cheat sheet
